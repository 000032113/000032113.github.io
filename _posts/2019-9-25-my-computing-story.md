# My Computing Story!

## About Me
Im Jess Faid, the best computer scientist across the land! Although I also excel at other intelligent subjects, such as: 
Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Economics. Overall, I'm a pretty smart girl. :D

## My Computing History
At GCSE I did computer science, achieving an outstanding grade of 8, considering I had a cheeky nap in the exam. 
In the past I have programmed using the language of python, which was very easy because  it is quite a basic language. 
Honestly, I'm pretty sick at programming, even though I can't really remember python too well. I'm just so good that I could pick it up 
easily again.
